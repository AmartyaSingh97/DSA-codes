# DSA-codes
Data Structure and Algorithms Codes in Java.
This repository contains codes of LinkedList Class, Stack Class, Queue Class, Sorting algorithms etc. as of now.
I am adding these to keep these important codes at one place.
There are also some important questions included which are important for interviews.
